### 1. About the project

This project is cloned from the open-source implementation in paper "A Comparison of 10 Sampling Algorithms for Configurable Systems.", some Chinese comments will be added into the code. The original code can be download from

### 2. Inside the project

Brief introduction of project constructure.

1. Folder `bin/` saved the bytecode of Java code. 
2. Folder `bugs/` included the fault related files in 24 **C** projects, followed by each file there are some `.config` files which gave the different configurations to trigger the corresponding fault.
3. Folder `tables/` contained the covering array in T-wise algorithms.
4. Folder `src/` saved the relative Java code.   
5. File `bugs.xls` detailed the information of 135 faults.
